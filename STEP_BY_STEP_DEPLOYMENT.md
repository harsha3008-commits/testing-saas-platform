2. **IMPORTANT:** Copy this entire URL and save it in your notepad
3. Label it "BACKEND_URL"

**✅ Checkpoint:** Your backend should show "Live" status and you should have the backend URL saved.

---

## Phase 6: Connect Frontend and Backend (10 minutes)

Now we need to tell the frontend where the backend is, and tell the backend to allow the frontend.

### Step 6.1: Update Frontend Environment Variable

1. Go back to your Vercel tab (or visit https://vercel.com)
2. Click on your **"testing-saas-platform"** project
3. Click on **"Settings"** tab at the top
4. In the left sidebar, click **"Environment Variables"**
5. Click **"Add New"** button
6. Fill in:
   - **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
   - **Value:** Your backend URL + `/api` 
     - Example: `https://testing-saas-backend-xyz.onrender.com/api`
   - **Environments:** Check all three boxes (Production, Preview, Development)
7. Click **"Save"**

### Step 6.2: Redeploy Frontend

1. Click on **"Deployments"** tab at the top
2. Find the most recent deployment (the top one)
3. Click the **three dots (...)** on the right side
4. Select **"Redeploy"**
5. Click **"Redeploy"** again to confirm
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for redeployment

**✅ Checkpoint:** Frontend is redeploying with the backend URL configured.

---

## Phase 7: Initialize Database (5 minutes)

The database needs to be set up with tables and schema.

### Step 7.1: Access Render Shell

1. Go back to your Render.com tab
2. Click on your **"testing-saas-backend"** service
3. Look for a **"Shell"** tab at the top
4. Click on it

### Step 7.2: Run Initialization Commands

You'll see a terminal interface. Type these commands one by one:

```bash
python
```

Wait for the Python prompt (`>>>`) to appear, then type:

```python
from database import init_db
init_db()
exit()
```

If you see any errors, that's okay - the schema might already be initialized.

**✅ Checkpoint:** Database schema initialized.

---

## Phase 8: Test Your Deployment (5 minutes)

### Step 8.1: Test Backend

1. Open a new tab
2. Visit your backend URL + `/docs`
   - Example: `https://testing-saas-backend-xyz.onrender.com/docs`
3. You should see **FastAPI documentation page** with a list of API endpoints
4. This confirms backend is working!

### Step 8.2: Test Frontend

1. Open a new tab
2. Visit your Vercel frontend URL
   - Example: `https://testing-saas-platform-xyz123.vercel.app`
3. You should see your landing page
4. Try navigating to different pages:
   - Dashboard
   - Organizations
   - Settings

### Step 8.3: Test Connection

1. Try to sign up or log in
2. If you can interact with forms and see responses, the frontend-backend connection is working!

**✅ Checkpoint:** Both frontend and backend are live and connected!

## Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations

**Vercel Free Tier:**
- 100 GB bandwidth per month
- Unlimited deployments
- Your site is always online

**Render Free Tier:**
- Backend **spins down after 15 minutes** of no activity
- First request after spin-down takes 30-50 seconds to wake up
- PostgreSQL database **expires after 90 days** (you'll need to backup and recreate)

### What Works Without Paid Services

Your platform will work for:
- User registration and authentication
- Project management
- Basic testing features
- Analytics and dashboard
- Team collaboration

### What Requires Paid API Keys (Optional)

These features need API keys (you can add them later):
- AI-powered fix suggestions (OpenAI API - ~$5/month for testing)
- Stripe billing (free to set up, only charges when you have transactions)
- Email notifications (many free options available)
- GitHub integration (free GitHub App)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend Shows Error

**Problem:** Can't connect to backend
**Solution:** 
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Vercel settings
2. Make sure it ends with `/api`
3. Redeploy frontend

### Backend Returns 500 Error

**Problem:** Database connection failed
**Solution:**
1. Check `DATABASE_URL` in Render environment variables
2. Make sure you used the Internal Database URL, not External

### Backend Takes Forever to Load

**Problem:** Backend is spinning up from sleep
**Solution:**
- This is normal on free tier
- First request after 15 minutes of inactivity takes 30-50 seconds
- Subsequent requests are fast
